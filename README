Purpose: 		

			This is the CSC431 final project.
			
Collaborators:	

			Christin Mirabelli
			Michael Schmitt
				
Overview:		

			Due Mar 17, 2012

			Rewrite all the algorithms seen in class in C++, java, C#, D, Go, Javascript,
			Scala, Haskell, Erlang, or Clojure, including tests (not including functions
			that require data downloading, assume loading data from CSV File). The
			algorithms should include proper documentation strings explaining the pur-
			pose of the algorithm, the input and the output, and possible exceptions. It
			is not necessary to explain how the algorithm works. (30 points)
			You MUST use a version control system like GIT or Mercurial and make
			your code publicly available. Your code MUST be released under the BSD
			license. I will check your commit history.

			By February 6, 2012 you must have chosen the language and provide a
			working implementation of the Linear Algebra algorithms and a link to the
			code repository (I recommend GitHub). (10 points)

			For the Final project you can work in groups of 2 or 3 students but you
			have to Finalize your groups by February 6 and must include a report about
			the roles of each member of the group.
